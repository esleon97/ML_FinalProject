# ML_FinalProject

The notebooks in this repository require .npy files containing arrays with waveform, baseline slope, and power spectral density data for an inverted-coaxial point-contact detector from the LEGEND-200 experiment. 
Alternatively, one can use any one or two-dimensional array saved in .npy file to feed into the convolutional autoencoders (the code has to be modified accordingly to load the data)
